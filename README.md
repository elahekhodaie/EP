# Fictitious-Mean-field-Q-learning
This simulator implements the "Fictitious Mean-field Q-learning" algorithm in a distributed system. The setting includes strategic agents who compete over a set of heterogenous servers. Through rigorous experiments, we show that this algorithm outperforms naive deployment of single-agent Q-learning.
The environment variables can be found in the config text file.
discreteRun is the implementation of the original distributed system
Test runs are becnhmarks
